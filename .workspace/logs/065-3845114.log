# git-graph

![git-graph screenshot](docs/git-graph.png)

`git-graph` draws readable Git history graphs that follow well-known branching models. It helps teams reason about their release process by grouping branches, merges, and releases into a structured layout.

## Features
- Draws Git graphs that follow `git-flow`, `simple`, or `none` branching models
- Highlights active branches, merges, and tags in a compact Unicode or SVG rendering
- Configurable branch colors via named ANSI colors or 0-255 palette indices in model files
- Supports dense (`--sparse` off) and sparse (`--sparse`) graph styles
- Limits commits via `--max-count` and shows the complete history with `--all`
- Focuses on local development with `--local` to hide remote tracking branches
- Outputs SVG via `--svg` and includes a debug rendering with `--debug`

## Installation
- **Crates.io**: `cargo install git-graph`
- **From source**: clone the repository and run `cargo install --path .`
- **Pre-built binaries**: download the artifact attached to the latest GitHub release

# git-graph Manual

> TODO[report]: The original manual content is not fully provided in the archival report. This reconstruction keeps the documented structure and intent based on the commit summary.

## Overview
"'`git-graph` renders readable Git history graphs that follow well-known branching models. The tool groups branches, merges, and release tags to make release engineering conversations easier. Use this manual together with `git-graph --help` to explore every option available in the CLI.

## Installation
- **From crates.io**: `cargo install git-graph`
- **From source**: clone the repository and run `cargo install --path .`
- **Pre-built binaries**: download the latest release asset and place it in your `$PATH`.

The manual refers to configuration files stored in `${config}/git-graph/`, where `${config}` typically resolves to `~/.config` on Unix-like systems and `%APPDATA%` on Windows.

## Quick Start
1. Run `git-graph --max-count 50` inside any Git repository to render a compact text graph.
2. Add `--svg > graph.svg` to emit an SVG version, then open the file in your browser.
3. Explore alternative branching models with `git-graph --model simple` or `git-graph --model none`.

## Command Reference
- `git-graph --help` prints all CLI switches.
- `git-graph --path <dir>` lets you execute the command outside of the repository root.
- `git-graph --all` draws every reference, including remote branches.
- `git-graph --local` filters remote tracking branches to focus on local work.
- `git-graph --sparse` enables a condensed layout with fewer merge arcs.
- `git-graph --max-count <n>` caps the number of commits considered during rendering.
- `git-graph --debug` outputs an ASCII rendering that is useful while developing custom models.

### SVG output
- Use `git-graph --svg > graph.svg` for a vector representation.
- Pipe the SVG into `rsvg-convert` or `inkscape --export-png` to obtain bitmap assets.

## Branching Models
The presets shipped with `git-graph` live in `src/settings.rs`:
- `git-flow`: treats `master`/`main`, `develop`, `feature/*`, `release/*`, `hotfix/*` and `tags/*` as first-class citizens.
- `simple`: highlights `master`/`main` and `tags/*` while using a shared palette for every other branch.
- `none`: renders every branch with the fallback colors.

Switch models by running `git-graph --model <preset>`. The choice can be persisted per-repository with the `model` subcommand explained below.

## Custom Branching Models
Custom models are stored as TOML files in `${config}/git-graph/models/`. Each file may override branch persistence, ordering, and the terminal/SVG color palette.

```
# ${config}/git-graph/models/custom.toml
[persistence]
branches = ["''^(master|main)$", "''^release.*$", "''^feature.*$"]

[order]
branches = ["''^(master|main)$", "''^develop.*$", "''^release.*$", "''^feature.*$"]

[terminal_colors]
unknown = ["bright_blue", "bright_magenta", "bright_green"]
[[terminal_colors.matches]]
pattern = "''^release.*$"
colors = ["bright_green"]
```

Apply the model with `git-graph model use custom`. List known presets via `git-graph model --list`. The palette names correspond to the ANSI 0-255 index documented in the README.

> TODO[report]: The original commit rewrote this section. Precise examples will need verification once the authoritative manual content is available.

## Performance
Large repositories benefit from a few targeted flags:
- `git-graph --max-count <n>` limits the number of commits processed.
- `git-graph --local` skips remote branches that you rarely inspect.
- `git-graph --svg` produces a single image without keeping the intermediate Unicode layout in memory.

The commit report mentions that the manual adds a dedicated performance chapter with benchmark guidance. Re-run the measurements on representative repositories and update this section with concrete numbers once they can be recovered.

## Troubleshooting
- Ensure you are running inside a Git repository (`git status` succeeds).
- Use `RUST_LOG=git_graph=debug` to enable tracing when diagnosing configuration issues.
- Remove stale cached models in `${config}/git-graph/models/` if branch colors do not update as expected.

# git-graph Manual

> TODO[report]: The original manual content is not fully provided in the archival report. This reconstruction keeps the documented structure and intent based on the commit summary.

## Overview
"'`git-graph` renders readable Git history graphs that follow well-known branching models. The tool groups branches, merges, and release tags to make release engineering conversations easier. Use this manual together with `git-graph --help` to explore every option available in the CLI.

## Installation
- **From crates.io**: `cargo install git-graph`
- **From source**: clone the repository and run `cargo install --path .`
- **Pre-built binaries**: download the latest release asset and place it in your `$PATH`.

The manual refers to configuration files stored in `${config}/git-graph/`, where `${config}` typically resolves to `~/.config` on Unix-like systems and `%APPDATA%` on Windows.

## Quick Start
1. Run `git-graph --max-count 50` inside any Git repository to render a compact text graph.
2. Add `--svg > graph.svg` to emit an SVG version, then open the file in your browser.
3. Explore alternative branching models with `git-graph --model simple` or `git-graph --model none`.

## Command Reference
- `git-graph --help` prints all CLI switches.
- `git-graph --path <dir>` lets you execute the command outside of the repository root.
- `git-graph --all` draws every reference, including remote branches.
- `git-graph --local` filters remote tracking branches to focus on local work.
- `git-graph --sparse` enables a condensed layout with fewer merge arcs.
- `git-graph --max-count <n>` caps the number of commits considered during rendering.
- `git-graph --debug` outputs an ASCII rendering that is useful while developing custom models.

### SVG output
- Use `git-graph --svg > graph.svg` for a vector representation.
- Pipe the SVG into `rsvg-convert` or `inkscape --export-png` to obtain bitmap assets.

## Branching Models
The presets shipped with `git-graph` live in `src/settings.rs`:
- `git-flow`: treats `master`/`main`, `develop`, `feature/*`, `release/*`, `hotfix/*` and `tags/*` as first-class citizens.
- `simple`: highlights `master`/`main` and `tags/*` while using a shared palette for every other branch.
- `none`: renders every branch with the fallback colors.

Switch models by running `git-graph --model <preset>`. The choice can be persisted per-repository with the `model` subcommand explained below.

## Custom Branching Models
Custom models are stored as TOML files in `${config}/git-graph/models/`. Each file may override branch persistence, ordering, and the terminal/SVG color palette.

```
# ${config}/git-graph/models/custom.toml
[persistence]
branches = ["''^(master|main)$", "''^release.*$", "''^feature.*$"]

[order]
branches = ["''^(master|main)$", "''^develop.*$", "''^release.*$", "''^feature.*$"]

[terminal_colors]
unknown = ["bright_blue", "bright_magenta", "bright_green"]
[[terminal_colors.matches]]
pattern = "''^release.*$"
colors = ["bright_green"]
```

Apply the model with `git-graph model use custom`. List known presets via `git-graph model --list`. The palette names correspond to the ANSI 0-255 index documented in the README.

> TODO[report]: The original commit rewrote this section. Precise examples will need verification once the authoritative manual content is available.

## Performance
Large repositories benefit from a few targeted flags:
- `git-graph --max-count <n>` limits the number of commits processed.
- `git-graph --local` skips remote branches that you rarely inspect.
- `git-graph --svg` produces a single image without keeping the intermediate Unicode layout in memory.

The commit report mentions that the manual adds a dedicated performance chapter with benchmark guidance. Re-run the measurements on representative repositories and update this section with concrete numbers once they can be recovered.

## Troubleshooting
- Ensure you are running inside a Git repository (`git status` succeeds).
- Use `RUST_LOG=git_graph=debug` to enable tracing when diagnosing configuration issues.
- Remove stale cached models in `${config}/git-graph/models/` if branch colors do not update as expected.

## Further Reading
- `README.md` for a concise overview and feature list.
- `docs/manual.md` (this document) for in-depth explanations of every flag and configuration file.
- `git-graph --help` for authoritative CLI documentation generated at build time.

## Usage
```
git-graph [OPTIONS]
```

Common flags:
- `--model <preset>` selects `git-flow` (default), `simple`, or `none`.
- `--local` / `-l` shows only local branches; remote branches such as `origin/*` are hidden.
- `--sparse` switches to the sparse rendering style (compact is default).
- `--svg` prints the graph as SVG; redirect to a file for further processing.
- `--path <dir>` / `-p` starts repository discovery from `<dir>` so you can run the tool outside of the repo root.
- `git-graph model <preset>` persists the branching model for the current repository.
- `git-graph model --list` prints the available presets stored in the configuration directory.

**Ensuring documentation consistency and planning tests**

I’m making sure the new sections have consistent blank lines and that no contradictory text appears after rewriting the Custom branching models explanation. The docs reference a missing image, but that’s already noted. Since changes are docs-only, building isn’t needed, but I’ll run `cargo test` to verify correctness without network access, as recommended by the instructions.

     8	## Installation
     9	- **From crates.io**: `cargo install git-graph`
    10	- **From source**: clone the repository and run `cargo install --path .`
    11	- **Pre-built binaries**: download the latest release asset and place it in your `$PATH`.
    12	
    13	The manual refers to configuration files stored in `${config}/git-graph/`, where `${config}` typically resolves to `~/.config` on Unix-like systems and `%APPDATA%` on Windows.
    14	
    15	## Quick Start
    16	1. Run `git-graph --max-count 50` inside any Git repository to render a compact text graph.
    17	2. Add `--svg > graph.svg` to emit an SVG version, then open the file in your browser.
    18	3. Explore alternative branching models with `git-graph --model simple` or `git-graph --model none`.

**Summarizing final changes and test results**

I'll explain the added manual skeleton and README updates with line references, note the TODO placeholders due to missing content, and mention the `cargo test` failure caused by an existing compile error related to `Repository` cloning; then I’ll outline these details in a clear bullet format for easy scanning.
[2025-09-21T19:54:48] codex

Added the manual scaffold and expanded README with the manual/performance notes described in the report.
- `README.md:7-53` links to the new manual, rewrites the preset guidance, and adds dedicated “Custom branching models” plus “Performance” sections reflecting the documented scope.
- `docs/manual.md:1-81` reconstructs the manual’s structure (overview, commands, models, performance, troubleshooting) with `TODO[report]` markers wherever the archive lacked the original prose or benchmarks.

Assumptions / gaps:
- Manual prose and benchmark data were unavailable in the LaTeX snapshot, so placeholders note the missing source material (`docs/manual.md:3`, `docs/manual.md:61`, `docs/manual.md:69`, `docs/manual.md:81`).

验证:
- `cargo test` (fails: existing `src/graph.rs` expects an owned `Repository`; current tree clones a reference, causing `E0308` before our changes). Consider rerunning after the underlying clone fix is restored.

Next steps:
1. Restore the authentic manual text and benchmark tables once accessible.
2. Address the pre-existing `Repository` ownership regression so the test suite builds again.
